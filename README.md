# Sound-Pads
Frontend Development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React


### Description
A small interactive audio pad web app built with React. The user can click any pad to play a corresponding sound. Each pad lights up while the sound is playing, creating a real-time visual + audio feedback experience. It’s responsive across different screen sizes, thanks to Flexbox, Grid and media queries.

This project demonstrates state management, parent–child component communication, how to control audio using the `useRef` hook and responsive design. It is inspired by the [Scrimba Learn React course](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) I completed.


### Features
* Interactive sound pads with real-time playback;
* Visual feedback (pads light up only while sound is playing);
* State management using the `useState` hook, and parent-child communication with props;
* Responsive layout, 4x2 grid on desktop, 2x4 on mobile.


### Tools
* HTML `<audio>` element with `useRef`;
* CSS Flexbox, Grid & Media Queries – styling, layout and responsiveness;
* React – functional components, state and props.
